      </header1>
      <p>
        I was born in Northampton General Hospital on the 11th May 1998. Since I was born, I've lived in Northampton in the area called St. James. I have four sisters and no brothers making me the only boy in the family. I have two sisters older than me, and two sisters younger than me, placing me in the middle.

      <p>
 I first started school when I was four years old going to Quinton House School which is a private school. I stayed here until I was 10 when I moved to St. James Primary School and then The Duston School where I completed my GCSE's and my A-Levels. I am now a student at the University of Northampton studying Computing and I wish to become a Software Engineer with my degree.

      <p>
In the future, I wish to get a good job with my degree and move out of Northampton. It has always been a dream of mine to travel the world so one day I would love to visit different countries and experience different culture.
