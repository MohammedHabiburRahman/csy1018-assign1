csy1018 Web Development Assignment 1
# Supporting Documentation
This is the supporting documentation for my E-Portfolio. Below I have included the research stages, the wireframes, the different prototypes, the progression of the site, the code used from other sources and the full code of my website.
# Research Stage
Before making my site, I needed to research similar E-Portfolios in order to get inspiration for my own. I took the good ideas and the positive aspects from other sites such as a consistent colour scheme and a professional image. Some aspects I wished to avoid were the outdated elements such as flashing text and moving banners as these are not the latest styles used in modern day websites.
One site I looked at was an e-Portfolio for 'Jessica Gilpin'. This can be found at http://jag0038.wixsite.com/jgilpin.
One of the aspects of this site that appealed to me was the layout of the site. This is as everything was structured and in a professional order. So I wanted to incorporate this within my own site.
Another site I looked at was an E-Portfolio for Patience Marsh. http://patiencelatta.wixsite.com/portfolio. On this site, one aspect I didn't like was the images as they were scattered around and made the site look messy and unprofessional. This is why in my own site, I wish to keep images neat and tidy and have a professional image.
