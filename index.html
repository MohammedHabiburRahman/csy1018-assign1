        My name is Habibur Rahman. I am a student studying Computing at the University of Northampton. I am 18 years old and I currently have a part time job as a customer service assistant in Sainsbury's. With my degree, I hope to become a software engineer and work for a respectable company. I was born in Northampton, England while my parents were born in Bangladesh. Below is a short link to my CV which can also be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
